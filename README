BUGS, PATCHES & FIXES

By its very nature the size of grid is the only limiting factor of this
module. If you can create a grid that is too large to fit in memory, the
author recommends that you not to do that!

There are no known bugs at the time of this release. However, if you spot a
bug or are experiencing difficulties that are not explained within the POD
documentation, please submit a bug to the RT system (see link below). However,
it would help greatly if you are able to pinpoint problems or even supply a 
patch. 

Fixes are dependent upon their severity and my availability. Should a fix not
be forthcoming, please feel free to (politely) remind me by sending an email
to barbie@cpan.org .
