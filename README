BUGS, PATCHES & FIXES

By its very nature the size of grid is the only limiting factor of this
module. If you can create a grid that is too large to fit in memory, the
author recommends that you not to do that!

If you think you've found a bug, have a suggestion for an enhancement or
are experiencing difficulties that are not explained within the POD
documentation, please send an email to barbie@cpan.org or submit a bug to the
RT system (http://rt.cpan.org/). However, it would help greatly if you are 
able to pinpoint problems or even supply a patch. 

Fixes are dependant upon their severity and my availablity. Should a fix not
be forthcoming, please feel free to (politely) remind me.
